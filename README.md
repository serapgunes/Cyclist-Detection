# Cyclist Detection

A project developed using YOLOv8 for detecting cyclists and adding labels to live video. This project aims to provide a real-time detection system that enhances the safety of cyclists by utilizing advanced computer vision techniques.

## Project Overview

This project, developed in collaboration with @serapgunes, detects cyclists in real-time and overlays labels on them. Our future plans include migrating this project to a VR (Virtual Reality) platform as Mixed Reality to enhance its perspective and adapt it to real-time travel.

The goal of our project is to provide practical solutions with high-accuracy models and use technology innovatively to improve the safety of cyclists.

## Project Process

- We trained the model using 8,000 labeled data augmented by the Augmentation method and YOLOv8 model.
- During the training and testing process, 70% of the data was used for training, 20% for testing, and 10% for validation.

## Analysis and Results

**Performance Metrics:**
- Accuracy: 84.6%
- Recall: 96.5%
- Precision: 87.3%
- F1 Score: 91.7%


These results indicate that our model can detect cyclists with high accuracy and is successful in its task.
